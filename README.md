## :bulb: What is emotion recognition?

Emotive analytics is an interesting blend of psychology and technology . Though arguably reductive, many facial expression detection tools lump human emotion into 7 main categories: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Contempt, and Disgust. With facial emotion detection , algorithms detect faces within a photo or video, and sense micro expressions by analyzing the relationship between points on the face, based on curated databases compiled in academic environments.
